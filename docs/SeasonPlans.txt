Season Plans:

Skills focused robot
The Goals: GET INTO STATE > GET INTO WORLDS

Where are we right now:
Joey's CAD design
A wheel
We know what we want to build

Robot design statement
Our robot will have a fast, strong triangle drivetrain, a forlift, pneumatic locking system, robot-lifting hooks

Drivetrain: 6 motors, 2 per wheels
Forklift: 2 motors (Has hanging capacity, forklift arms bend up so that we don't disturb the goals, flicks out via robot movement forces at start)
Pneumatic Locking system: The Goal rests in the forklift at a slight angle towards the robot. The pole is tilted into a U shape, that closes around the pole when activated. This U lock stablizes the tall goal and keeps the small goals from sliding out while we are moving.
Robot lifting hook: On the back of the forklift. When forklift goes down, this goes down with it.

Programming Goals:
Driver Program Goals: Make it as easy as possible for the driver to drive and the programmer to program.
Auton Goals: Make a smooth and consistent auton using all necessary sensors form the beginning
Comp. Auton: Score a goal or two and mess up the other team's auoton
