So far I have developed a logging system. I have also done some reasearch on neural networks. We still need to write the robot neural network interpreting code and the actual neural network tuning code. To complete these two tasks we will need to know the exact architecture of the neural network, which is something we still have no idea about. Mr. Moore suggested we use Matlab, so I will be doing furthur research into that. Tomorrow there is a robotics practice from 4-7. I think I will spend that time working out the neural network, as I have now realized that is the next step. -Caleb Buening
