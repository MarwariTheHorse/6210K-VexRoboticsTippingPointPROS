# 6210K-VexRoboticsTippingPointPROS - LiftBot code
The amazing code repo for all the PROS code of 2021-2022.

-----------------------

This years code controls a 6 motor drivetrain (two left, two center, two right) and a lift,
with a pneumatic grip for grabbing the scoring objects. Along with the average driver
code and autonomous code successes, we also succeeded in designing a neural network to
operate the grip autonomously in any situation. The solution was insanely accurate, and even
learned to react to certain situations we hadn't thought of while training it.

### Authors:
* Caleb Buening
* Joey Curnutt
* Mark Dai
* With Stephen Moore as a mentor

### A brief description of each folder/file
* firmware - All the autogenerated stuff used for uploading to the robot
* include - All the files involving the two api's used to interact with the robot: pros and okapi
* src - our code
    * main.cpp - Currently contains our auton methods, auton code, and driver code
    * Also includes all of COPilot - python code, model files, etc.

### Auton helper
* To help with theoretical code, we made an auton helper. Go to https://github.com/joeycurnutt/VexRoboticsAutonHelper to see/use the code
