# 6210K-VexRoboticsTippingPointPROS
The amazing code repo for all the PROS code of 2021-2022.

NOTE: The code in this repo as of now is for the neural network test bot.

The Plans for this season:
Fall: Build the robot, (Base>Mechs>Tuning), Program the foundation to the program
Winter: Caleb works on neural network, building it up from the ground, and other enhancements while Joey puts the auton together. Builders fix things.
Spring: Make things perfect and test the neural network

Todos:
- Write training code for the computer
	- Loads NN or creates one, trains based off of loaded data, saves the updated NN
- Write run-code for the robot
	- Loads NN file, calculates #'s based off of it, goes.
