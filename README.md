The amazing code repo for all the PROS code of 2021-2022.

Currently this code is written for a robot with a 6 motor drive + a ring intake and a ring director + pneumatics for grabbing two cones. If this does not end up being the final plan, at least we will have some code to use.

The Plans for this season:
Fall: Build the robot, (Base>Mechs>Tuning), Program the foundation to the program
Winter: Caleb works on neural network, building it up from the ground, and other enhancements while Joey puts the auton together. Builders fix things.
Spring: Make things perfect and test the neural network
