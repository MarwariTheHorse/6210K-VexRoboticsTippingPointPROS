The amazing code repo for all the PROS code of 2021-2022.

NOTE: The code in this repo as of now is for the neural network test bot.

The Plans for this season:
Fall: Build the robot, (Base>Mechs>Tuning), Program the foundation to the program
Winter: Caleb works on neural network, building it up from the ground, and other enhancements while Joey puts the auton together. Builders fix things.
Spring: Make things perfect and test the neural network
