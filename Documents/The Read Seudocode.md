The Actual Seudocode for the Robot of This Year

Things to consider:
* Currently, if the robot brain looses connection during the auto, it is all over. Is there and easy way to fix this?
* We need to be able to easily implement any of my crazy ideas if they work

Parts of the robot:
* Drivetrain **via two Okapi motor groups in a chassis** (6 motors)
* Ring intake **via a Okapi motor** (1 motor)
* Ring director **via a Okapi motor** (1 motor)
* Pneumatics for both mogo grabbers **via PROS ADI Digital Out** (2 pneumatics)
